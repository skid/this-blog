# This Blog

"This Blog" is a blogging engine made for people that like markdown and the command line. It's a single-user, no database application written in node.js.

## Features

- Simple publishing mechanism - use a single command
- No database or static file servers - all data is kept in files
- Blog posts are single files and contain their own configuration
- Can handle multiple languages
- Can tag posts and dynamically build tag categories
- Posts can have their own templates or use the provided master

## Installation

**Note:** Since This Blog depends on connect >= 2.0.0 and that version still isn't published to NPM, the npm install will fail. Please checkout this git repository, cd into it and use npm to manually install the dependencies. You can checkout connect 2.0.0alpha elswhere and then link it into the `node_modules` directory.

To use it, you will have to make 2 installations, one on your server and one on your local machine:

    npm install this-blog

## Usage

#### Setting up

Before you start it, you need to edit the `settings.json` file in the root directory. Your local and remote installation **must** have the same settings for these options:

    remoteUrl:    "example.com"
    remotePort:   80
    password:     "icanhazcheezburger"
    contentDirs:  ["posts", "templates", "static"]
    
You need to get these to be the same on your server and local installation. Everything else is configurable later. The `remoteUrl` and `remotePort` are the public URL and port of your blog. The `password` is used to authenticate you when you publish posts.

You can start your server by running 

    node blog.js -s 

on your server.

#### Publishing

To upload posts, images and templates start adding them in one of the `contentDirs` that you defined. Normally your posts would go in the _posts_ directory, templates in the _templates_ directory, but This Blog uses only the file extension to make difference between posts and other files. Any file with the `.md` extension will be treated like a post.

After you're done publish your changes by running 

    node blog.js -p 
    
on your local machine.
    
### Configuration

Here's an overview of the configuration options in the `settings.json` file:

    port:        The port for the node server to listen to (if you use a proxy)
    remotePort:  The public port for your blog (should be 80)
    remoteUrl:   The public URL of your blog
    password:    Authentication password - needs to be the same
    contentDirs: Dirs scanned for content changes before publishing
    gaCode:      Google analytics key
    postsUrl:    Url path for posts (with leading slash)
    tagsUrl:     Url path for tags (with leading slash)
    adminUrl:    Url path for publishing (passworded, with leading slash)
    errorLog:    Error log filename 
    maxExcerpts: Maximum number of posts shown on a tag/home page
    pagination:  Maximum number of pagination links
    languages:   List of languages - ["en", "mk"]
    langinfo:    Hash of language names - {"en": "English", "mk": "Македонски"}
    sitemenus:   List of menus that posts can appear in - ["bookmarks", "2011"]
    strings:     A hash of stranslation strings for each language

Apart from the `settings.json` file, you can also configure your posts individually by using headers. A post filename should look like this:

    This is my first post.en.md

It has to have the `md` extension for it to be treated like a post. The ".en" part tells This Blog the language of the post. If it's ommitted, the first language in your `languages` settings will be used. To have the same post on another language, just do this:
  
    This is my first post.en.md  # English Version
    This is my first post.mk.md  # Macedonian Version

Posts are further configured by using headers. All posts must start with a set of HTTP-like headers. Headers must be the first thing in the post file and **are over when the first instance of 2 consecutive newlines is found**

Here's an example post file:

    Language:     en                    # This is found in the filename 
    Title:        My First Post         # This appears as the title (<h1>)
    Date:         2011-12-19            # Must be a date in the ISO format
    Description:  Nothing special       # META description
    Menus:        Bookmarks             # One of the menus in which it appears
    Tags:         Blog, Node.js         # Post tags

    Notice the 2 new lines. This is the beginning of the post. We ommit the
    title because it will be automatically added for us from the headers.
    
    This part is the post excerpt. Notice the 5 dashes in-between double 
    linebreaks (\n\n-----\n\n). That's the excerpt delimiter. Everything before
    those dashes will appear in the list on the homepage/tag pages. If you
    ommit those dashes, the whole post will appear on the homepage along with
    other posts.

    This is the continuation of the post. This will be visible only on the
    post page.
